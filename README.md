# Pass Wizard
This project is designed to predict students' grades in two secodary schools [Gabriel Pereira, Mousinho da Silveira] in Portugal in Portuguese Language Course.
> Project for the course: Learning Analytics, International studies in engineering, Master of computer engineering, University of Duisburg-Essen.

# Features
## Users can do the following:
1. Check how attributes and features are correlated to exams' grades.
2. Have a clear idea about their predicted grades through an interactive decision trees.
3. Get the predicted result (fail/ pass) for all exams (first, second, and final) at the beginning of the semester.
4. Get the predicted result (fail, medium, and high) for second exam after getting first exam's result<br />(fail: less than 10, medium: from 10 to less than 15, high: from 15 to 20).
5. Get the predicted result (fail, medium, and high) for final exam after getting second exam's result<br />(fail: less than 10, medium: from 10 to less than 15, high: from 15 to 20).

# Try on Heroku
[Pass Wizard](https://passwizard.herokuapp.com/)
> "It takes several minutes for Heruko to activate both workloads:<br />Two different workloads were used in Heroku to deploy this project, one for our backend and one for the frontend.<br /> The first request caused the Heroku to wake up the frontend workload.<br /> Then frontend will send the request to the backend, which subsequently caused Heroku to wake up the backend workload.<br /> So it takes a few minutes before both are operational."

# Technical architecture
The application consists of two main parts:
* Backend: responsible for: <br />Machine Learning <br />Server-side web application logic, consists of a server, an application, and a database.
* Frontend: the part that users interact with it.

# Technologies/ libraries used
![Technologies](https://github.com/AmrShakhshirUDE/MLpassWizard/blob/main/Images/11.Technologies.png)
## Backend technologies
* Flask
* MongoDB for database
* Scikit-learn for machine learning
## Frontend technologies
* React
* Bootstrap
## Connecting frontend to backend
* Axios
* Postman: to test connectivity especially for 'POST' method
## Deploy technologies
* Gunicorn as a web server gateway interface "WSGI"
* mLab as a cloud database service
* Github
* Heroku

# How to run the project
> Make sure that you have mongoDB installed on your PC and we highly recommend you to use visual studio code as a code editor

## To run locally
> Make sure to have the file `numValuesComb.csv` in the same folder that contains `scikit.py`

1. Import `allData.csv` to MongoDB. [This](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/import-csv-file-into-mongodb-9b9b86582f34) tutorial will help you.

2. In the top level directory, go to `scikit.py` file.

3. In line.52 `app.config["MONGO_URI"] = "mongodb://localhost:27017/laprobk"` change `laprobk` to the name you've choosen to your DB.

4. In line.221 in the route `@app.route("/alldata")` change `df = mongo.db.<YOUR COLLECTION'S NAME>.find()`

5. Open terminal and go to the path of `scikit.py` then type the following:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scikit.py
```

* First command will install all required python packages to run this app <br />
* Second command will run the backend part of the app

The backend part should be running now.

6. Go to `client\src\contexts\urlContext.js`

comment line.3

`export const UrlContext = createContext('https://passwizardbackend.herokuapp.com/');`

uncomment line.4

`export const UrlContext = createContext('http://127.0.0.1:5000/');`

```
npm install
npm start
```

> If `npm start` doesn't work, do the following:
```
npm install rimraf -g
rimraf node_modules
npm start -- --reset-cache
```
then repeat step number 6

## To deploy
1. Import `allData.csv` as frontend dataset into Atlas (Cloud DB Service) <br /> 
and `numValuesComb.csv` as backend dataset into Atlas as a new collection in same database. [This](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/import/mongoimport/) tutorial may help you.

2. In the top level directory, go to `wsgi.py` file

go to line.52 and add `Mongo_URI` you got in step.1 for `allData.csv`
Also add this uri to line.63 between the parentheses.

3. In lines [56 to 58] add the credintials for backend collection from step.1.

4. In line.247 add the collection name for frontend collection.

5. Go to `client\src\contexts\urlContext.js`

uncomment line.3

`export const UrlContext = createContext('https://passwizardbackend.herokuapp.com/');` <br />
Here you should use the link that you'll get when deploying backend part to Heroku (step.7) instead of this link. <br />
Otherwise you'll be connected to our backend which will work regardless of whether you deployed your backend part properly.

comment line.4

`export const UrlContext = createContext("http://localhost:5000/");`


6. Seperate 'client' folder from main project folder to be deployed seperately as in the following guide


7. follow the guide [Deploy web app to Heroku](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpSK06odCvYdSyGkWmc-AdqRc3zmiHPCc), mainly you need to do as follows:
* Deploy backend app to heroku after pushing it to github. Please follow the steps in the upmentioned guide
* Create an account on mLab, currently migrated to mongoDB Atlas, make sure to name database and collection as written in the code, and finally connect backend app to mLab as explained in the upmentioned guide
* Push `client` file to a new github repository and deploy it to heroku. Please follow the steps in the upmentioned guide and __note that here you don't need to change url in axios part as you did that on step 5__
